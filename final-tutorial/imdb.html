      <h3>IMDB ratings histogram</h3>
      <div class="description">
        This shows the distribution of IMDB ratings (scores) across the data. The data looks normally distributed
        around a rating of 6.5. Mouseover each bin to view the rating range for that bin, the number of
        datapoints (movies) in the bin, and a sample of movies whose ratings fall within that bin range.
        <br><br>
        This chart is composed of three main parts: axes and rectanges, which are visible, and a histogram
        generator, which is a D3 function used to cut the data into equal-sized bins. Let's take a look at
        these in turn:
        <h4>Scales</h4>
        Scales are functions that map from an <strong>input range</strong> to an <strong>output domain</strong>.
        For example, the following will produce a function that scales its inputs by a factor of 10:<br><br>
        <div class="code">
          const scale = d3.scaleLinear().domain([0, 100]).range([0, 1000]);<br>
          scale(10) // 100<br>
          scale(20) // 200<br>
          scale(0.5) // 5<br>
        </div>
        <h4>Axes</h4>
        D3 offers four different functions that generate axes:
        d3.axisBottom(), d3.axisLeft(), d3.axisRight(), and d3.axisTop().
        These all specify different orientations. d3.axisBottom, for instance, ensures ticks
        emerging from the axis point downwards, so we can use this one as an x-axis.
        The ticks generated from d3.axisLeft point towards the right, so we can use that one as a y-axis.
        An axis generator takes as input a scale function, and we can chain some other useful
        things to them like tick formatters.<br><br>
        <div class="code">
          const scale = d3.scaleLinear().domain([0, 100]).range([0, 1000]);<br>
          const tickFormatter = d3.format('$');<br>
          tickFormatter(4239) // $4239
          const axis = d3.axisBottom().scale(scale).tickFormat(tickFormatter);<br>
        </div><br>
        To actually draw the axis, we'll need to bind it to a DOM element. This is a bit different from data
        binding, which we'll see below. An axis is comprised of a bunch of different elements -- the main axis
        line, tick lines, and tick labels. We'll group these all in a "g" element, and hand off this group
        selection to the axis function:<br><br>
        <div class="code">
          // append returns the group selection<br>
          // think of .call(axis) like axis(groupElement); these are equivalent<br>
          svg.append('g').call(axis);<br>
        </div><br>
        <h4>d3.histogram()</h4>
        Our IMDB data is an array of objects, each representing a movie with the following attributes:<br><br>
        <div class="code">
          {<br>
            title: "Avatar",<br>
            score: "7.9",<br>
            date: "2010-11-12",<br>
            budget: "237000000",<br>
            gross: "760505847",<br>
            genres: "action__adventure__fantasy__sci-fi",<br>
            keywords: "paraplegic__native__marine__avatar__future",<br>
            num_fb_likes: "33000.0",<br>
            num_users_voted: "886204",<br>
            synopsis: "When his brother is killed in a robbery ... fight back in an epic battle for the fate of Pandora.",<br>
          }<br>
        </div>
        <br>d3.histogram() is a function that helps us generate a histogram from an array of values. We can use it like:<br><br>
        <div class="code">
            const numBins = 30;<br>
            const accessor = d =&gt; parseFloat(d.score);<br>
            const histGenerator = d3.histogram().value(accessor).thresholds(numBins);<br>
            const hist = histGenerator(data);<br>
        </div><br>
        The .value() call uses an anonymous function to access whichever value from the array of data that
        we'll pass in. In this case we're accessing the IMDB rating (score) and converting it to a float. numBins
        specifices a <strong>heuristic</strong> d3 will use to generate the number of bins. The actual number of
        bins is NOT guaranteed to be equal to this value, so hist.length !== numBins. The histogram generator
        takes as input our data array and returns an array containing the histogram bins. The histogram looks like:<br><br>
        <div class="code">
          hist // [Array(4), Array(13), Array(23), Array(49), ... Array(64), Array(9)]<br>
          hist[0] // [Object, Object, Object, Object, x0: 1.6, x1: 2]<br>
        </div><br>
        So a bin is an array of values belonging to that bin, and two values, x0 and x1, specifying where the bin was cut.
        This example's bin ranges from x0 = 1.6 to x1 = 2, i.e., contains movies with ratings between 1.6 and 2,
        and contains bin.length === 4 objects, i.e., has a frequency of 4.<br>
        <h4>Binding data</h4>
        We've formatted our data into the right representation, but how do we actually visualize it in the DOM?
        We want to generate a rectangle for each bin:<br><br>
        <div class="code">
          const binWidth = width / hist.length; <br>
          svg.selectAll('.bin') <br>
            .data(data)               // Bind data to selection <br>
            .enter()                  // Return the new elements selection <br>
            .append('rect')           // Append a rect for each element in selection <br>
            .attr('x', d =&gt; xscale(d.x0)) // x, y coords of rect are its top-left corner <br>
            .attr('y', d =&gt; yscale(d.length)) // frequency scaled to pixel val <br>
            .attr('width', binWidth) <br>
            .attr('height', height - yscale(d.length)); <br>
        </div><br>
        SVG rectangles take four main attributes: an (x, y) pixel coordinate representing the top-left corner
        of the rectangle, a width, and a height. The width is simple: since we want to show equal-width bins,
        dividing the width of the visualization by the number of bins gives us the bin size. The x coordinate
        is where we want to place the bin on the x-axis (ratings). Remember that x0 is where the bin starts.
        Scaling x0 with our scaling function gives us a pixel value we can use to place the rect in the svg
        container. A similar logic holds for the y-value and for the rect height. Note that since a webpage's
        pixel grid starts from 0 at the top (the reverse of what we're used to in a typical Cartesian coordinate space),
        we subtract the pixel-scaled frequency from the height.<br><br>
        And there we have it! A histogram:

      <h3>IMDB rating x number of votes scatterplot</h3>
      <div class="description">
        The histogram shows us the distribution of ratings across our data, and with the added interactivity
        we can drill down a little bit and see some examples. With its unusually good rating of 8.6,
        Interstellar places in the right tail of the distribution. But is this score meaningful? What if it was
        actually a terrible movie and only me and Matthew McConaughey had voted on it? What if me and Matthew McConaughey
        were dating? A movie rating that aggregates only a few opinions loses credibility. That's why recommendation
        systems use normalization methods to filter out good content from the unknown dross. We can use a scatterplot
        to visualize the spread of ratings across votes. The movies in the top right are ones that have high votes
        and high ratings, and are likely better indicators of quality. <br><br>

        So how are we going to graph this? Let's first define how to access the data we want:<br><br>
        <div class="code">
          const xval = d =&gt; parseFloat(d.score);<br>
          const yval = d =&gt; parseFloat(d.num_users_voted);
        </div><br>
        Find the min and max of each dimension and use these to generate our scales and axes:<br><br>
        <div class="code">
          const xextent = d3.extent(data, xval);<br>
          const yextent = d3.extent(data, yval);<br><br>

          // Assuming 750 is the width of the x-axis and 350 is the height of the y-axis<br>
          const xscale = d3.scaleLinear().domain(xextent).range([0, 750]);<br>
          const yscale = d3.scaleLinear().domain(yextent).range([350, 0]);<br><br>

          const xaxis = d3.axisBottom().scale(xscale);<br>
          const yaxis = d3.axisLeft().scale(yscale);<br><br>

          svg.append('g').call(xaxis);<br>
          svg.append('g').call(yaxis);<br><br>
        </div><br>
        And then bind the data to SVG circle elements in the DOM, positioning the circles on the x and y axis by scaling
        them to the correct pixel value:<br><br>
        <div class="code">
          svg.selectAll('.point')<br>
            .data(data)<br>
            .enter()<br>
            .append('circle')<br>
            .attr('class', 'point')<br>
            .attr('r', 5) // Has a radius of 5px<br>
            .attr('cx', d =&gt; xscale(xval(d)))<br>
            .attr('cy', d =&gt; yscale(yval(d)))<br>
            .attr('opacity', 0.7); // Decrease opacity so we can see overlapping points<br>
        </div><br>
        That's it!<br><br>

        A few outliers stand out: The Dark Knight and The Shawshank Redemption both have an outstanding score <i>and</i>
        number of votes. The Godfather, Pulp Fiction, Inception, Fight Club, and Lord of the Rings: Return of the King
        also stand out. On the other end, we have some Justin Beiber movie I'm glad I've never heard of with a record-low
        rating of 1.6, and also a smaller number of votes. There are a few outliers with low ratings but higher
        number of votes than other low-scoring movies: Twilight, Fifty Shades of Grey, and Batman &amp; Robin. These were
        popular movies that attracted a lot of attention but that remained (rightfully) bereft of critical approval.<br><br>
        This visualization also seems to detect a bias: people tend to go out and vote only for movies they think are good.

      <h3>Budget and gross revenue over time</h3>
      <div class="description">
        Another question that might be interesting to answer: have movie budgets increased over time? Has revenue followed
        suit? Let's plot a time series to find out.<br><br>

        Define accessor functions that will let us grab the data we want from each value in our data array. We're going to be
        plotting budget/revenue on the y-axis and time on the x-axis:<br><br>
        <div class="code">
          const xval = d =&gt; new Date(d.date);<br>
          const budget = d =&gt; parseFloat(d.budget);<br>
          const gross = d =&gt; parseFloat(d.gross);<br>
        </div><br>
        We define and draw our axes the same as before. The only difference is that this time we'll use d3.timeScale, which
        is capable of reading in and scaling dates:<br><br>
        <div class="code">
          const xscale = d3.scaleTime().domain(d3.extent(data, xval)).range([0, width]);
        </div><br>
        In order to get an average over time, let's bin our data like we did with the histogram, passing in a heuristic of 40 bins
        to get a more granular breakdown than the histogram above:<br><br>
        <div class="code">
          const hist = d3.histogram().value(xval).thresholds(40)(data);<br><br>

          // This returns the average budget/gross in each bin and then scales it to a pixel value<br>
          const avgBudget = bin =&gt; yscale(d3.mean(bin, budget));<br>
          const avgGross = bin =&gt; yscale(d3.mean(bin, gross));<br>
        </div><br>
        Instead of plotting bars, we're going to plot lines using d3's line function. The line function takes our
        input data, and for each value in the array, generates an (x, y) coordinate for that value and then
        interpolates a line between all of the coordinates. Since we're not drawing rects, we want each (x, y)
        point to be placed in the center of each bin. The step function below defines the x position of each point
        on the line.<br><br>
        <div class="code">
          // x-position<br>
          const step = width / hist.length;<br>
          const xpos = (d, i) =&gt; step / 2 + step * i;<br><br>

          // Functions to generate both lines<br>
          const budgetLine = d3.line().x(xpos).y(avgBudget);<br>
          const grossLine = d3.line().x(xpos).y(avgGross);<br>
        </div><br>
        Finally, we call the line functions with our raw data and bind the generated line data to an SVG path element:<br><br>
        <div class="code">
          svg.append('path').datum(hist).attr('d', budgetLine);<br>
          svg.append('path').datum(hist).attr('d', grossLine);
        </div><br>
        It looks like there's a slight upwards trend over time for both budget (in blue) and gross revenue (in red).
        Hovering over the bins gives you the average budget and gross revenue in each bin, the year range for that bin,
        and a sample of movies from the bin. Since each bin shows an average, the movie sample might not be that informative,
        since it's not guaranteed to represent points near the average. In fact, the interpretability of the entire chart
        suffers from the consequence of looking at an average -- each year probably saw both expensive and cheap movies. It
        would be more informative to also plot the median and top/bottom quartiles. It would also be interesting to slice this
        data up by rating. For example, we could have a slider at the top that filters the data by rating, only showing budget
        and gross revenue for movies above the given rating threshold (COMING SOON!).

      <h3>IMDB Topic Network</h3>
      <div class="description">
        Omg, finally something sexy! Everyone loves a network visualization, especially when it bursts into being like a muted
        firework, drifting off into an idle web of skeletal connections. D3 exposes one main module to create networks: d3-force.
        A force network takes at minimum a set of nodes and then applies some forces to those nodes. The forces define how the nodes
        interact: whether they're attracted to each other, repel each other, how close the cluster to the center, whether there is a
        center, what happens if they collide, etc. It's also more than just a network -- it's actually a <strong>simulation</strong>,
        where in each timestep the given forces are applied to the nodes, and the nodes' positions are updated accordingly. The
        simulation is generated by the d3.forceSimulation() function. A simulation can also take a set of links, which define edges
        between nodes.<br><br>

        We're going to create a network with some basic forces that link up nodes based on whether or not they have a keyword in common.
        I wrote a script that generates networks of varying sizes and link strengths. These are stored in the data/networks/ directory.
        A node is a movie, and is colored based on its rating -- high ratings tend red, low ratings tend blue. A link occurs between two
        nodes if the node shared keywords. The number of keywords shared determines the link strength, or the edge width.
        The data looks like:<br><br>

        <div class="code">
          // Value from nodes array<br>
          {<br>
            name: "Shutter Island",<br>
            score: 7.2,<br>
          }<br><br>

          // Value from links array<br>
          {<br>
            source: Object, // Shutter Island node<br>
            target: Object, // Sixth Sense node<br>
            overlap: ["surprise ending", "plot twist"],<br>
          }<br>
        </div><br>

        To construct our network we're going to first initialize a force simulation with three different forces:
        <br><br>1. A link force acting along the edges between nodes: <strong>d3.forceLink()</strong>.
        <br><br>2. A force that acts upon multiple bodies (in this case, nodes), repelling or attracting them: <strong>d3.forceManyBody()</strong>.
        <br><br>3. A force creating a gravitational center: <strong>d3.forceCenter()</strong>. This will center the simulation at a given location.
        <br><br>

        <div class="code">
          // Tell the force how to uniquely identify nodes, so that nodes from<br>
          // the nodes array can be linked up to edges from the links array.<br>
          const forceLink = d3.forceLink().id(d => d.name);<br><br>

          // A positive strength causes nodes to attract each other -- this will<br>
          // cause nodes to collapse into each other. A negative strength causes<br>
          // nodes to repel each other.<br>
          const forceCharge = d3.forceManyBody().strength(-3);<br><br>

          // Centers the simulation at the given x and y coordinates.<br>
          const forceCenter = d3.forceCenter(center.x, center.y);<br><br>

          // Create a new simulation with the above forces<br>
          const simulation = d3.forceSimulation()<br>
            .force('link', forceLink)<br>
            .force('charge', forceCharge)<br>
            .force('center', forceCenter);<br>
        </div><br>
        Now we create the SVG nodes and links (circles and lines):<br><br>
        <div class="code">
          // Links are lines with width equal to the number of keywords<br>
          // the nodes it connects have in common.<br>
          const link = svg.append('g')<br>
            .selectAll('.link')<br>
            .data(data.links)<br>
            .enter()<br>
            .append('line')<br>
            .attr('stroke-width', d => d.overlap.length);<br><br>

          // Nodes are circles with a fixed radius, color-scaled by the ratings<br>
          // of the movies they represent.<br>
          const node = svg.append('g')<br>
            .selectAll('.node')<br>
            .data(data.nodes)<br>
            .enter()<br>
            .append('circle')<br>
            .attr('r', 5)<br>
            .attr('fill', d => rating(d.score));<br>
        </div><br>
        And finally we start the simulation by initializing it with the data:<br><br>
        <div class="code">
          simulation.nodes(data.nodes).on('tick', tick);<br>
          simulation.force('link').links(data.links);
        </div><br>
        The "on" event listener listens for incoming "tick" events and then executes a tick function.
        A tick event is broadcast for each time interval of the simulation, during which D3 applies
        the forces to the nodes and links, updating their positions in the data. After the simulation
        is launched, our node value from the nodes array looks like this:<br><br>
        <div class="code">
        {<br>
          index: 452, // position in array<br>
          name: "Shutter Island",<br>
          score: 8.1,<br>
          vx: 0.00588898398528427, // velocity in x direction<br>
          vy: 0.0007826748713994405 // velocity in y direction<br>
          x: 1049.975431527609 // x-position<br>
          y: 296.54156968726323 // y-position<br>
        }<br>

        The simulation directly updates the value in our array with position and velocity. What it <i>doesn't</i>
        do is update the corresponding SVG elements. We have to define what happens to the SVG elements ourselves:<br><br>
        <div class="code">
          function tick() {<br>
            link<br>
              .attr('x1', d => d.source.x)<br>
              .attr('y1', d => d.source.y)<br>
              .attr('x2', d => d.target.x)<br>
              .attr('y2', d => d.target.y);<br><br>

            node<br>
              .attr('cx', d => d.x)<br>
              .attr('cy', d => d.y);<br>
          }<br>
        </div><br>
        When we run this code, the simulation repeatedly calls force.tick(), via something like setInterval().
        The simulation has a cooling parameter called alpha. When simulation slows down until the layout has
        reached a near-optimal solution, or alpha is close to 0. You can see this happening on load: the
        nodes rapidly expand away from the center and then slowly grind to a halt.<br><br>

        A few immediate visual insights become apparent. There are a few clusters of tightly interconnected and
        tangled nodes in the middle. As we move outwards, clusters become sparser. There are more triangles and orphans.
        The presence of so many orphan nodes is due to the fact that I only allowed edges between nodes that shared
        at least <strong>two</strong> keywords in common. The network should actually be a lot more interconnected than this.
        I specified this threshold to limit the number of edges rendered in the browser, and I also took a sample of 2000
        movies from the original 5000. The number of links in the full network amounted to <strong>416,948</strong>, which is
        too overwhelming for the browser to handle. You can try it by loading network.json and adjusting the d3.forceCharge
        strength parameter. It won't crash your browser but it'll be laggy and extremely dense.<br><br>

        Using this stricter notion of similarity, we can investigate the clusters and see which movies are related by keyword,
        or topic. Mousing over a node gives you the movie and rating; mousing over an edge gives you the keywords the two nodes
        have in common. Some of the triangles are interesting, like the sad "strong female leads" triangle of just three movies,
        or the highly specialized "flight attendants" triangle (Flightplan, Flight, and Elizabethtown, originator of the first ever MPDG).<br><br>

        There are some weird edges that make less sense, like "The Holiday" and "Harry Potter", two movies unified in my mind only
        by the saving grace of charming British accents. These are connected in the network by the overbroad keywords of "love"
        and "book". Other clusters make a lot of sense -- there's a cluster of only Jurassic Park movies, one with only superhero
        movies, and another predominantly featuring supernatural elements like werewolves and vampires. The big welter of connections
        near the bottom are all related to murders, serial killers, FBI, detectives, police, and related themes. The less dense
        cluster north of that features similar themes with an espionage angle. And the cluster to the left of that is clearly sci-fi.<br><br>

        It'd be interesting to see which movies connect those three big clusters. From what I can tell, "Men in Black" seems to bridge
        the gap between the sci-fi and espionage cluster, which makes sense. "The Avengers" looks like a hub node connecting the espionage
        cluster with the detective cluster.<br><br>

        There's a lot more we could do with this, including specifying new similarity metrics to generate new types of networks, and
        playing with the parameters of the force simulation to tinker with the visual layout and positioning of the nodes and links.
